# snapshot-vote
Script to do some automated voting strategies on snapshot.page. Votes as defined in json files it gets as input (logic is abstracted away to other repo, see [snapshot-query](https://github.com/al-matty/snapshot-query)). Alternatively you can manually create a "choices.json" with the same structure.
